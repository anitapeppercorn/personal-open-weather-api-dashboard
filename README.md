  #### README describing the project.Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. I have been tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of my own to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.I have been asked to use the OpenWeather API (Links to an external site: https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.  I have used localStorage to store persistent data.
  
  ### An Application for a Weather Dashboard
  I have utilized Open Weather API to create a simple weather forecasting app.Approach: When a new city is submitted within the input form:We insert the value of url and run it through ajax to get weather informationWe create a button and add it to the list of the name of the city. When this button is clicked again, we run it through a fetch againWe use Get to fetch the information and use .text ( ) to show the information on screen. We use Moment.js for the date on the titleWe use an API call to get the 5 day forecast and then render it on a new card. Since UV index is a different api documentation, make a new function that takes the longitude and latitude from the response parameter and put them inside UV index api. Render the UV index number and color then return the function using closure so we can pass the response to UV index function as parameterWe use Moment.js JS to manipulate add feature to set the future date
  
  ### User Story AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly #Acceptance Criteria GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs WHEN I search for a city THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index WHEN I view the UV index THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity WHEN I click on a city in the search history THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that cityMock-Up: The Mockup image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:weather dashboard demoGrading Requirements
